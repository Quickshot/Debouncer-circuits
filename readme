This project contains several different kinds of debouncing circuits done in VHDL.

Following debouncers are implemented:

Rising edge debouncer: In this debouncer, output goes directly to one when the
input signal goes high, and stays there until input has been zero for at least
the number of clock cycles defined.

Sampling debouncer: Samples the input signal at predetermined intervals. Output
is set to input value when the current sample and the previous sample are same, otherwise
current output value is held.
